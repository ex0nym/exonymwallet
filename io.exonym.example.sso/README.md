# SSO Demonstration #

This is a basic demonstration of Exonym's SSO.  

> There's no database, so if the server is restarted then all account 
information is lost.

Exonym's authentication capabilities are based on its decentralized 
cryptographic identity system, which enables the creation and management of multiple pseudonymous identities. This system is designed to provide a high level of privacy and security while also allowing for trustworthy transactions without centralized control.

In the context of a web server, Exonym's authentication capabilities can 
be used to verify the identity of users accessing the server's resources. 
By leveraging Exonym's pseudonymous identities, the server can provide 
users with a secure and private way to authenticate themselves without 
requiring the use of traditional username/password combinations.

With the help of the Exonym SDK, developers can easily integrate Exonym 
authentication into their web applications. The SDK provides a range of 
tools and libraries for interacting with Exonym, including support for 
pseudonymous identity creation and management, and SSO management.

By integrating Exonym authentication into a web server, developers 
can leverage the power of decentralized rulebooks to create a 
trustless, transparent, and community-driven authentication system. 
This approach provides users with a level of privacy and security 
that is not possible with traditional authentication methods, while 
also enabling decentralized governance and control over web resources.
