# Exonym CLI
The `exonym_cli` is a command line interface designed for developers  
to interact with the Exonym system, manage bot wallets, 
and develop with Decentralised Rulebooks. It provides a simple yet 
powerful interface for solidifying rulebooks, which are the foundation 
of the Exonym governance framework. 

While still in the early stages of 
development, the `exonym_cli` offers a range of useful features for those 
interested in exploring the potential of Decentralised Rulebooks and 
experimenting with the Exonym system. Despite its current state of 
roughness, the `exonym_cli` holds great promise for those seeking to 
build and integrate with Decentralised Rulebooks.
