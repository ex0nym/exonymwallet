# Identity Mixer

> __IBM Research__

The Identity Mixer repository is a powerful cryptographic library that 
enables privacy-preserving authentication and authorization for various applications. This library supports various protocols for identity management, such as the Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) and Identity Mixer protocols. With its advanced cryptographic techniques, the Identity Mixer library ensures that sensitive user data is kept secure and private.

Version 3.0.36 of the Identity Mixer library had a dependency on the 
guice library, which can cause issues with conflicting dependencies 
in some projects. In response to this, this version of the 
library has replaced guice with Dagger2, which is a more 
lightweight and flexible dependency injection framework. This update 
ensures that the library is easier to use and integrate with other projects.
