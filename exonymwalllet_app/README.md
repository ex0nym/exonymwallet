# Exonym Wallet

Welcome to the Exonym Wallet App, an early-stage project aimed at providing 
a user-friendly interface for managing Exonym wallets. The app is currently 
in a rough state of development, but we are excited about the potential 
of this project and the benefits it will bring to users of the Exonym
ecosystem.

The App is being developed using the Flutter framework, which allows 
for cross-platform development and enables the app to run on both Android 
and iOS devices. The app provides basic wallet management functionalities 
such as creating a new identity containers, importing an existing ones, 
authenticating with services, or generating of remote certificates 
(active proofs of honesty).

It is important to note that the App is still in the early 
stages of development and is not feature complete. We appreciate 
your patience and understanding as we work to make it production ready.

Thank you for your interest and we look forward 
to bringing you updates on the project as it progresses.
